# ComWriter

This is a small C++ console application that will write out a number of ".com" files.  All of the files are executable in a DOS environment.  They will print "Hello World!", but the string file has a simple obfuscation applied.

PREREQUISITES:

Visual Studio 2017 - to compile the project.

DosBOX - To execute the .com files.

UxD - To visualize the .com files.


YASM - I used the one embedded in the Android NDK.  


The one in at (https://yasm.tortall.net/Download.html) should work as well, but I have not test.
